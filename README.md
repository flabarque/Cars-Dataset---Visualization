# Cars-Dataset---Visualization

The period between 1970 and 1982 marked a significant shift in the United States car industry. American production shifted from heavy, powerful, six- and eight-cylinder cars with poor gas mileage to lighter, less powerful, four-cylinder cars with higher fuel efficiency.

The global auto industry, including Americans and their European and Japanese competitors, raised overall miles per gallon (MPG) by focusing on four-cylinder cars and making them more fuel-efficient.

The dataset contains 398 unique cars along with their respective specification, origin country, and model year. This dataset is a version of the CRCARS dataset of Donoho & Ramos (1982): "PRIMDATA: Data Sets for Use With PRIM-H", used at the 1983 American Statistical Association Exposition. The StatLib library at Carnegie Mellon University stores the original version of this dataset (http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/cars.data).
